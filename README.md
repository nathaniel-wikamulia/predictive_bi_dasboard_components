# Predictive BI Dashboard for Bakery Business

The scripts in this repository are scripts that are used to create a predictive BI dashboard for a bakery business. Although the script used in this project can be published, the data used for this project cannot be shared due to an agreement with the bakery not to share company-owned data.

There are three codes in this repository:
  1. A script to create an XGBoost machine learning model to perform demand forecasting on the amount of bread that must be produced by a bakery.
  2. A script to create a Mini Batch K-Means model to perform Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM) analysis in order to categorize bakery customers according to their        transaction patterns.
  3. A script to change the shape of the transactional database's data to match the structure of the data warehouse.
