# predictive_bi_dasboard_components
The scripts in this repository are scripts that are used to create a predictive BI dashboard for a bakery business.

There are three codes in this repository:
  1. A script to create an XGBoost machine learning model to perform demand forecasting on the amount of bread that must be produced by a bakery.
  2. A script to create a Mini Batch K-Means model to perform Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value (RFM) analysis in order to categorize bakery customers according to their        transaction patterns.
  3. A script to change the shape of the transactional database's data to match the structure of the data warehouse.
